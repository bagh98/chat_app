# Flutter Simple Chat App

This repository contains a Flutter UI for a simple chat application using Firebase for backend services. It features user authentication (login and signup) and a chat interface for real-time messaging.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user login and signup using Firebase Authentication.
*   **Real-time Chat:** Enables real-time messaging between users using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.
*   **User List/Search:** Displays a list of users to start a chat with (optional).
*   **Message Display:** Shows messages in a clean and organized chat interface.
*   **Basic UI:** A simple and intuitive user interface for easy navigation and messaging.




## Technologies Used

*   Flutter
*   Dart
*   Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database/Firestore)
*   [List any other relevant packages, e.g.:]
    *   `firebase_core`
    *   `firebase_auth`
    *   `firebase_database` or `cloud_firestore`
    *   `provider` or `bloc` (for state management - optional)

## Getting Started

1.  **Create a Firebase project:**

    *   Go to the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)) and create a new project.

2.  **Register your Flutter app with Firebase:**

    *   In your Firebase project settings, add a new Android and/or iOS app.
    *   Follow the instructions provided by Firebase to download the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files.
    *   Place these files in the appropriate directories in your Flutter project (usually `android/app/` and `ios/Runner/`).

3.  **Enable Authentication and Database/Firestore in Firebase:**

    *   In the Firebase console, go to Authentication and enable the sign-in methods you want to use (e.g., email/password).
    *   Go to Realtime Database or Firestore and create a database instance. Configure the security rules as needed (for a basic chat app, you might start with relaxed rules for testing, but remember to tighten them for production).

4.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [invalid URL removed]
    ```

5.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

6.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

7.  **Configure Firebase in your Flutter app:**

    *   Make sure you have correctly added the `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files as described in step 2.
    *   Initialize Firebase in your Flutter app. This is typically done in the `main()` function:

        ```dart
        import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
        import 'firebase_options.dart'; // generated by flutterfire configure

        void main() async {
          WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
          await Firebase.initializeApp(
            options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
          );
          runApp(MyApp());
        }

        ```

8.  **Connect a device or start an emulator:**

9.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## How to Use

1.  Launch the app.
2.  You will be presented with the login/signup screen.
3.  Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
4.  After successful authentication, you will be taken to the chat screen.
5.  [If implemented] Select a user from the user list to start a conversation.
6.  Type your message and send it.

## Firebase Configuration

This app uses Firebase for user authentication and real-time data storage. Ensure that you have correctly configured Firebase for your project as described in the Getting Started section.
